Team Members: **Ioan BAȘNIC, Sebastian BELEA, Petra HORVATH**
## What is it?
How To Lose In 4 Steps is the implementation of the classic game, Connect 4. In a nutshell, our program is nothing more than a small TCP application that uses various tehnologies like BSD sockets. 

## Architecture
As an architecture, the application is comprised of two major components, the `client` side and the `server` side. 
* **Client** We can regard the `client` as the frontend of the application. It deals with all the interactions that the app might have with the client, and displays a helpful graphic representation of the Connect 4 board that we are all very used to. In addition, it gives the client suggestive hints of what steps he/she is supposed to take and whether the input received from him/her was erroneous or not. Finally, it sends the server the next step that the client decided to take.

* **Server** If the `client` is the frontend, then, it's only natural that the `server` would be regarded as the backend. Besides connecting to and handling the turn of the 2 clients, it is responsible for doing any algorithmic computations and send confirmations, updates or game statuses to both client processes.

## Technologies
BSD sockets

## Main Features
```
* Playing a two player game of Connect 4 in 2 different terminals.

* **[0-4]** - Game status

## Error code meaning
* **0** - No errors
* **1** - Invalid input length (S2C)
* **2** - Invalid character (S2C)
* **3** - Invalid move (S2C)
* **4** - The other player's server is down
